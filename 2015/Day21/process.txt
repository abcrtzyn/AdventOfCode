The player begins first
Each turn, Boss Health -= PAttack-BArmour
           Play Health -= BAttack-PArmour

This is actually wrong because there is always 1 damage done each turn, i still ended up getting the right answer

player Turns = ceiling Boss Health / (PAttack-BArmour)
adjusted = celing Boss health / (max(1, pattack,barmour))
boss Turns = ceiling Player Health / (BAttack-PArmour)

to win, player turns < boss turns
