This problem is finding the sum of the factors greater than the input/10.
Because each presents number is multiplied by 10, just reduce the input.

sum of divisors * 10 > [input]

ex.
house 4, factors 1,2,4. total 7
house 7, factors 1,7. total 8
house 24, factors 1,2,3,4,6,8,12,24. total 40


831600



Part 2
Divide input by 11
