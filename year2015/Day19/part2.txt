Notice that there is no need to actually find the replacement path
Each replacement expect for RnAr replacements take 2 elements and replace them with 1
For the purposes of counting, Rn(...)Ar counts as 1 element
Number of replacements is the number of elements in the string minus 1 plus the reduction of each parenthesis



All notes below are old (trying to figure out how this part works)


Notice a few things about this string and replacements
1. CRn does not exist, so no need to try those replacements


3. Rn and Ar can only be reduced using few replacements in pairs too. With or without a Y
So, they are like open and close parentheses. 
Everything between the Rn and the Ar must be reduced to F or Mg and there needs to be an appropriate element in front to catalyze
