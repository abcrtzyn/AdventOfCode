If I choose an edge based on minimum and maximum coords, 
expect for cases where the diamond touches the edge
From what I can see, this is true.
So. Do the following
choose min/max x and y. For each cell in the array, mark which point is closest

count all the marks per point
Any point that has a mark on the edge of the array, ignore them (infinite)



part 2
instead of marking points, list the sum of the distances from all points
