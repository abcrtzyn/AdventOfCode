We are looking for a number to put in r0 such that r3 will equal r0 as soon as possible
Since r0 does not change in this program
We are looking for what the value of r3 the first time on ip=28

part one is the number in r3 after removing the last three lines of code

part two requires finding the number that occurs before one appears twice

program summary
random string check that doesn't matter one bit
loop
    r2 <- r3 | 2^16 
    start with a big number in r3
    loop 
        modify r3 in various ways
        break on some r2 condition
        r2 <- r2 / 256
    endloop
    break if r3 != r0
endloop
