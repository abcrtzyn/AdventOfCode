2023.05 solve with APL. Not easy
2016.08 make a program to solve
2015.01 easy and cool haskell solution
2015.06 should be a good one for haskell
2015.12 part2 APL JSON values
2015.16 python or haskell solutions, or both
2016.01 haskell
2016.02 haskell and maybe apl
2016.04 apl
2016.08 potentially implement a program
2016.11 refactor python more
2024.08 potential apl solution
2024.12 try apl, at least a partial solution
2024.13 apl solution should not be difficult
2024.14 apl solution for part 1, interval index please
2024.15 clear up and unify both solutions
2024.19 good candidate for Haskell, memozation
2024.22 with all the iterators, might be interesting in Haskell
