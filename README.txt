My solutions to Advent of Code.
So far, I have completed 2015, 2016, 2023, and over half of 2018 and 2021

I like to try to solve them in APL. I am also playing with Haskell. There may be some assembly for Ben Eater's 6502 computer or maybe some Basic.

Advent of Code has been an excellent learning oppurtunity for learning about different types of problems, data structures, and languages.

I first try to quickly find a solution, but then will go back through and make solutions better.

The folder the scripts assume they a run from is the year folder, meaning move into 2023 and run python3 Day01/part1.py
I may change this in the future, but that is currently how I work on these problems.

Python scripts are run from a virtual python environment in the base folder.
Dyalog scripts are run using dyalogscript
Haskell programs are compiled using ghc and run as a program
