# My solutions to Advent of Code

So far, I have completed 2015, 2016, 2023, and over half of 2018 and 2021.

Advent of Code has been an excellent learning oppurtunity for learning about different types of problems, data structures, and languages.

I have enjoyed working in APL and learning Haskell.

Advent of Code is not all about programming but also about problem solving. Occasionally there will not be any code, or there will be code that has nothing to with the input because I have done some work by hand to better understand the problem.

An example of this is the assembly puzzles. In some instances, rather than writing an interpreter to run the assembly code, I will work through it by hand to see what it does. I try and leave some notes about what my thought process is.

I first try to quickly find a solution, but then will go back through and make solutions better.

Most scripts assume they are run from inside the year folder, meaning move into 2023 and run ```python3 Day06/main.py```

I may change this in the future, but that is currently how I work on these problems.

Python scripts are run from a virtual python environment in the base folder.

Dyalog scripts are run using ```dyalogscript Day01/apl.apl```

Haskell programs are compiled using ```ghc``` and run as a program
