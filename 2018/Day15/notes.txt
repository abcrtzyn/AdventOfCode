    identify all open squares in range(adjacent) of tagets
    the current square counts
    if there are no open adjacent squares, end turn

    decide which selected square is the closest
    ties broken by reading order
    if unreachable, end turn
    move towards that square most efficiently, ties broken by reading order

    if in range - attack
    select target with lowest HP, break tie reading order
    deal 3 damage

count number of rounds, excluding the last one
