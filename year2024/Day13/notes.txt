what a funny problem
It could be seen as an optimization problem
The fact that a limit of 100 is given is weird. Is it for the sake of making it easier or tractable

I do see that all distances are positive, you cant do negative button presses
That means the limit of 100 button presses is not even useful

The first example, its two equations and two variables
[1]: 8400 = 94*A+22*B
[2]: 5400 = 34*A+67*B
minimize tokens = 3*A + B

[2]*47: 253800 = 1598*A + 3149*B
[1]*17: 142800 = 1598*A + 374*B
[2]*47-[1]*17: 111000 = 2775*B -> B = 40

Part 1 appears to just be an algebra task

We aren't given a answer for the test input on part 2
Numpy isnt giving me the right answer, I wonder if I am going to have to keep them as integers to keep the precision
