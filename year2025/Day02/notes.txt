In part 1, the invalid IDs are some n repeated twice. So invalid IDs can only be even length.

They would have a general form of
n * (10^(# of digits) + 1)
# of digits is approximately log10

for searching, going through all possible wrong ids for a given order of magnitude is going to be faster than checking all numbers in a range.
